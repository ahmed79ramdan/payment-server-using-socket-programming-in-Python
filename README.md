# Payment Server Using Socket Programming In Python
  
## Server Code :

This code creates a socket object, binds it to a specific port and address, and listens for incoming connections from clients. When a client connects, it sends a message to the client and then closes the connection.


## Client Code: 

This code creates a socket object and uses it to connect to the server at the specified hostname and port. Once the connection is established, it receives data from the server and then closes the connection.
